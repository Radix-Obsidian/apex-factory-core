# DECISIONS — Apex Factory

Decision log. Each entry: what we chose, and why, so future runs don't relitigate it.

## D1 — ralphy is shelved (not installed)
The blueprint's outer-loop wrapper `ralphy` is **not used**. Its npm identity couldn't be verified
(registry 403'd), so it's untrusted; and `loop.sh` already runs the ECC `loop-operator` directly, so a
wrapper is YAGNI. **Revisit only** if we ever want a wrapper, and only after a sandboxed
`npx ecc-agentshield scan` clears it. Until then the loop has zero dependency on it.

## D2 — Stripe CLI deferred to gate-time
`stripe` CLI is **not installed** and `stripe login` is **not run** tonight. Build-to-PR has no live
charge surface — TEST-mode keys (or none) suffice. The CLI + interactive login are only needed when
the publish+charge gate opens. Deferring removes one interactive login from the critical path.

## D3 — heartbeat model
`heartbeat.sh` is mechanical ($0, local-only). The OpenClaw cron that runs it uses OpenClaw's **default
agent model** to narrate the result — OpenClaw's model config lives outside this control plane. That's
~4 short runs/day = negligible burn. A *true* OpenRouter-free narration path is a follow-up; not faked here.

## D4 — company ⟂ product (the standard)
`apex-factory-core` (private) is the **company/operator**. It never becomes a sellable product. Each
**product** is a separate SKU repo (`The-Native-Factory` = SKU #1) with its own Stripe + deploy. One
factory, many SKUs — the studio/holdco model. Productizing the factory itself is a possible v2, not now.

## D5 — the gate is fail-closed
`deploy-guard.sh publish` refuses unless `.env PUBLISH_APPROVAL_TOKEN` is set **and** a matching runtime
`APPROVAL` token is supplied. Empty stored token ⇒ the gate can never open. Tonight it is empty by
design: the factory physically cannot charge a customer.

## D6 — key rotation: declined (founder's call)
The 10 plaintext keys found in `~/.claude/settings.json` during AgentShield triage are **not** being
rotated — founder decided. Closed; no longer tracked.
